# Certification Exercise made for the Winter School Cyberwal in Galaxia

The website of the school (https://cyberwalingalaxia.be/dashboard/) will provide the support of the lessons.

The support of the exercise will also be available there and a copy is available in the repo.

It is the first exercise of the 2 presented with the idea to go from certification to fuzzing test techniques.

The other part of the exercices is in a separate repo : https://github.com/cetic/winterschool-tp
